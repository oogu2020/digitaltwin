I am an AI Engineer with 3 of experience in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
I am an AI Engineer and ML Engineer that specializes in building robust, production-scale reasoning systems and agentic frameworks that move beyond mere model fine-tuning. I possess deep expertise in architecting compound AI systems, seamlessly integrating multimodal models (LLMs, vision, audio) to solve complex, real-world business problems. I demonstrate a proven ability to deploy these systems with relentless focus on optimization, latency, and cost-efficiency within a live environment. My core value lie in creating autonomous AI agents that directly enhance operational workflows, drive product innovation, and unlock new revenue streams. Ultimately, he is key force in transitioning AI from a research-centric prototype to a reliable, value-generating engine for the enterprise.
